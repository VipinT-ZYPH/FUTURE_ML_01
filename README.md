# 🚀 Machine Learning Internship – Project Portfolio

This repository consolidates three end-to-end machine learning assignments executed during my internship. The scope covers applied predictive modelling, dashboard analytics, and conversational AI deployment. All deliverables were implemented using Python (Google Colab), along with complementary platforms such as Power BI and Dialogflow.


## 📌 Task 1 – AI-Powered Sales Forecasting Dashboard

**Objective:** Build a time-series forecasting solution capable of predicting future sales and visualise it through an interactive BI dashboard.

**Key Outcomes**

* Designed and trained a demand forecasting model in Python
* Implemented Power BI dashboards including YOY, MoM trend, and dynamic filters
* Enabled data-driven forecasting insights for decision-making

**Tech Stack**

* Google Colab (Python, Pandas, Statsmodels / Prophet if used)
* Power BI

**Artifact Location**

* `/Task-1/` folder
* Contains notebook, `.pbix` dashboard, and imports


## 📌 Task 2 – Customer Churn & Subscription Prediction System

**Objective:** Build ML models capable of predicting customer attrition and premium subscription likelihood using classification algorithms.

**Key Outcomes**

* Data preparation, feature engineering, and model development
* Evaluated results using precision, recall, F1-score and ROC-AUC
* Interpreted high-impact churn indicators for business usage

**Tech Stack**

* Google Colab
* Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.)
* Matplotlib / Seaborn for analytics

**Artifact Location**

* `/Task-2/` folder
* Contains experimentation notebooks and supporting files


## 📌 Task 3 – Customer Support Chatbot (Dialogflow + Telegram)

**Objective:** Create and deploy an automated conversational assistant capable of addressing user queries and enabling self-service support interactions.

**Key Outcomes**

* Developed conversational intents for core support scenarios
* Exported and documented the Dialogflow agent
* Integrated and deployed to Telegram for real-time usage

**Tech Stack**

* Dialogflow ES/CX
* Telegram Bot API
* Python webhook (if applicable)

**Deployment**
The chatbot is available on Telegram here 👉

**Artifact Location**

* `/Task-3/` folder
* Contains the Dialogflow agent export and notebook related to NLU logic
